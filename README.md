How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User stories a short a simple definitions of a feature from the perspective of an end user. Creating user stories help humanize program needs by clarifying requirements and ensuring what you are developing is what the end user actually wants. User stories help prioritize features
  based on business values and end user needs. They serve as a medium between stakeholders and developers to better translate user wants and needs into something the developer can better understand.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  In the past I would use a more flexible waterfall approach. I would focus on the bigger project but continue testing features as I developed them. The flexiblity of Agile is outstanding and breaking apart complex programs into smaller more actionable peices makes the process less 
  daunting and more manageable. By creating "checkpoints" out of a more complex program it also has a sense of accomplishment that helps keep me motivated while working on more complex things. Continious integration is also a great way to showcase what you have done and keeps me
  alligned with the project goals.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
  Being a good team member means collaboration. Being able to collaborate with your team and take ownership of tasks that have been assigned to you. Communicating clearly is always extremely important to any team assignment. Remaining flexible and adaptable learning new skills 
  or being able to adapt to changing workplace environments and technologies will ensure future success and help the team in any obstacles they may find and with a good team they will be able to do the same with any obstacles I cannot overcome on my own.
